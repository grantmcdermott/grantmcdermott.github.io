See the back-and-forth&nbsp;<a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2013/04/more-on-non-aggression/#comment-862127777" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />Generally, I try to be as civil as possible when it comes to internet debates. (Often is the time that I've rewritten a response simply to tone down the rhetoric and eliminate any implied derision.) Certainly, I think that it is a good thing to try and interpret your opponent's arguments in a generous light.<br /><br />There are limits, though. Life's too short to spend it endlessly rebutting&nbsp;<i>non sequiturs</i> and side issues.
