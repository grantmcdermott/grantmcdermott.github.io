On May 22, I'll be be giving an online workshop entitled
**(Pretty) big data wrangling with DuckDB and Polars**.

Here is the description:

> This workshop will introduce you to [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and
[Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), two data wrangling libraries at the
frontier of high-performance computation. (See
[benchmarks](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/).) In addition to being
extremely fast and portable, both DuckDB and Polars provide user-friendly
implementations across multiple languages. This makes them very well suited to
production and applied research settings, without the overhead of tools like
Spark. We will provide a variety of real-life examples in both R and Python,
with the aim of getting participants up and running as quickly as possible. We
will learn how wrangle datasets extending over several hundred million
observations in a matter of seconds or less, using only our laptops. And we will
learn how to scale to even larger contexts where the data exceeds our computersâ€™
RAM capacity. Finally, we will also discuss some complementary tools and how
these can be integrated for an efficient end-to-end workflow (data I/O ->
wrangling -> analysis).

The attendance fee is 20 EUR/USD and all proceeds will be going towards aid
organizations in Ukraine. Please see the
[WFU website](https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine#h.xc2x33lbfxln)
for details.

I'm pretty psyched about these tools and use them all the time in my own work.
Please consider joining or sponsoring someone else. I promise to make it
worthwile and you'll be contributing to a good cause at the same time.

P.S. Workshop materials will be made available here:
