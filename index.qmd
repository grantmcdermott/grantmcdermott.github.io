I am a Principal Economist at Amazon, having recently returned to the private sector after an extended period in academia.

My professional interests are a mix of tech and environmental topics, with an emphasis on empirical tools and computation, especially in big data settings.

Much of my spare time is dedicated to various open-source software (OSS) projects. I am an advocate for open and reproducible science, and view OSS as the most effective and democratic means for delivering these outcomes.
