The website was built using GitHub pages, Jekyll and the very cool *Minimal Mistakes* theme (with minor tweaks) from [Michael Rose](http://twitter.com/mmistakes). Take a look at the [Minimal Mistakes website](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) for detailed instructions about creating your own website using this theme.
