## Working papers

"Sceptic priors and climate consensus." (Revised and submitted)

*How much evidence would it take to convince sceptics that they are wrong about climate change? I explore this question within a Bayesian framework. I consider a group of stylised sceptics and examine how these individuals update their beliefs in the face of current and continuing climate change. I find that available evidence in the form of instrumental climate data tends to overwhelm all but the most extreme priors. Most sceptics form updated beliefs about climate sensitivity that correspond closely to estimates from the scientific literature. However, belief convergence is a non-linear function of prior strength. It becomes increasingly difficult to convince the remaining pool of sceptics that they are wrong. I discuss the necessary conditions for consensus formation under Bayesian learning and show how apparent deviations from the Bayesian ideal still be accommodated within the same conceptual framework. I argue that a generalized Bayesian model thus provides a bridge between competing theories of climate scepticism as a social phenomenon.* ([Paper](http://raw.githack.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/master/paper/sceptic/sceptic.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [SM](http://raw.githack.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/master/paper/SM/sceptic-SM.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

"Hydro power. Market might."

*A central tenet of economic theory is that market power induces deadweight loss. This claim rests on an assumption that is difficult to verify empirically. Namely, that dominant firms produce less than the social optimum. I provide evidence of such restrictive behaviour using a rich dataset of Norwegian hydropower firms. The research design exploits exogenous variation in market power, arising from transmission bottlenecks and the formation of localized electricity markets. The unique production traits of hydropower production further helps to avoid empirical complications associated with marginal cost estimation and endogenous variation in the supply mix. This allows me to identify the causal impact of market power on firm behaviour in a reduced-form setting that requires minimal assumptions. I show that gaining pivotal status can cause firms to withhold production by as much as a two to five percent. My results suggest that even nominally competitive markets are susceptible to strategic manipulation and welfare losses.* ([Paper]({{ site.url }}/papers/hydro.pdf){:target="_blank"}.)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <i>Hydropower is the world's foremost source of non-fossil fuel energy. It is also characterised by a unique set of production features that have the potential to greatly simplify economic questions related to firm behaviour and output. I exploit these characteristics, together with plant-level data and exogenous variation in market power, to identify evidence of noncompetitive behaviour in the Nordic electricity sector. Consistent with economic theory, I show that increased market power causes firms to withhold production during inelastic demand periods, thereby yielding higher profits and driving up consumer prices. The larger takeaway is that even our most advanced markets are susceptible to price distortions and welfare losses under fairly common conditions.</i>

## Selected works in progress

"The value of mass information: Search in the Google era." With Christopher J. Costello and Michael B. Ward.

<!--
*A broad class of economic decision problems involves searching over a collection of uncertain research leads. Existing search theory informs the efficient search over this pool using available information. But in many cases, the researcher has the opportunity to collect new information en masse, e.g. with a search engine or scientific framework, that will benefit the search. We derive the value of this type of bulk information, determine the general properties that render it large or small, and calculate its implications for economic innovation. We show that changes to the underlying characteristics of different search problems can yield surprising results. For example, more lucrative end-prizes can actually reduce the value of information, while the possibility of better information often suppresses innovation.*
