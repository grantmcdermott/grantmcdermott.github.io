After spending nearly a year in <i>Land Economics</i>' publication queue, I'm pleased to say that my joint paper on "Electricity Prices, River Temperatures and Cooling Water Scarcity" is now <u><a href="http://le.uwpress.org/content/90/1/131.abstract" target="_blank">available online</u></a>.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>I've obviously discussed the paper on this blog and elsewhere before, but there's something ever-so-satisfying about seeing it typeset in official journal format.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>(For those that missed it and can't get passed the subscription paywall, a link to a working paper version and summary for the layman can be found <u><a href="{{ site.url }}/2013/01/14/electricity-prices-river-temperatures-water-scarcity/" target="_blank">here</u></a>.)</div><div><br /></div><div>To recap: We're expected to produce three papers for our PhD dissertation and this paper will obviously form the first of these for me. As for my next paper(s), I've been working on something more climate-related recently. I don't want to give too much away as my ideas are still evolving, but it's very much centered within the Bayesian paradigm and the way in which prior beliefs can affect society's best response to the climate problem. More updates to follow once I get closer finishing up a draft version!</div>
