I was quoted in a recent article about bringing power to
sub-Saharan Africa: "[**How do you bring electricity to 620 million
people?**](http://ensia.com/features/how-do-you-bring-electricity-to-620-million-people/)"
The journalist, Tom Jackson, did a good job of summarising my position
(although I am mildly annoyed that he didn't send me a copy before
publication; something I asked for). That being said, some additional
context never hurts and so I thought I'd publish my full email response
to his questions.

Two minor footnotes: First, this was framed as a "centralised versus
decentralised" debate. There are of course many variations on the
decentralisation theme. (Do you really mean distributed generation,
rather than transmission? Does this include microgrids? Etc.) Given the
way the questions were asked, I simply took it to mean the absence of a
centralised electricity grid. Second, when I talk about first-best and
second-best alternatives, I don't quite mean in the [strict economic
sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_second_best) of
optimality conditions. Rather, I am trying to convey the idea that one
solution is only really better when the other is unavailable due to
outside factors.

**Why are grids still vital? Why is a functioning electricity grid
necessary for economic growth?**

These two questions are more or less the same, so I'll take them
together. Large, centralised grids constitute the most efficient and
cost-effective way of delivering (and consuming) electricity in modern
economies. Not only are decentralised options substantially
[more expensive and (generally) less
reliable](https://stickmanscorral.blogspot.com/2013/10/why-functioning-electricity-grid-is.html),
there's no intrinsic reason to believe that they will be better at
[delivering a clean energy
future.](https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/is-the-future-of-electricity-generation-really-distributed/)

**Is the centralised argument being lost in places like SA where the
grid is so poor and not being improved?**

I wouldn't say that South Africa's present electricity woes are the
result of grid failure. Rather, the problem is primarily one of
generation capacity and government mismanagement. On that note, the grid
is the one component of the electricity system that is
[best thought of as a "natural
monopoly"](http://grantmcdermott.github.io/2012/11/18/natural-monopoly-electricity-sector).
(The other components of the electricity value chain -- i.e. generation
and distribution -- should then be left to competitive forces.) Your
question highlights an irony. Eskom's mismanagement on the generation
side (huge overspends and delays on the Medupi and Kusile power
stations, etc.) are undermining confidence in its ability to manage a
centralised grid, the one aspect that government can legitimately claim
needs to be operated as a regulated monopoly.

That all being said, [Eskom *is* falling
behind](http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-10-16-survivor-eskom-edition-in-two-easy-episodes/#.VWZj_E_ONBe)
the required investment goals for maintaining an adequate grid
infrastructure into the future. A deficient grid network has also
constrained economic growth in many other developing countries, from
Nigeria to India. And, yet, this is not to say that the decentralised
alternative offers an intrinsically superior solution. A grid system
remains the first-best option. Decentralised solutions are really a
second-best option in the absence of the former. The distinction is
crucial.

**What role for de-centralised solutions?**

I think that decentralised solutions will remain a second-best, niche
alternative for the next few decades. There are several things that
cause me to take this position, of which intermittency and local storage
are probably the most pronounced. Now, there do happen to be a number of
exciting developments on the storage issue, but nothing that I would
expect to fundamentally change the equation. More to the point, I
believe that the resilience of a decentralised generation system will
fundamentally *require* a functioning grid. The increased intermittency
and smaller scale of decentralised power production will necessitate
excellent access to similar, small-scale generation in other regions.
This can only be achieved through a robust grid network. (An example may
help to make my point: Germany's much-fÃªted
*Energiewende* was supposed to involve a fundamental shift towards the
decentralised paradigm. What we've seen in practice, however, is that
the [Germans are investing
hugely](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/10/norway-germany-cable-idUKL5N0VK2PY20150210)
in extending their inter-regional grid capacities to
places like Norway, whose [hydropower resources
offer](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096014811400072X)
[the most cost-effective
means](http://sciencenordic.com/norway-europe%E2%80%99s-cheapest-%E2%80%9Cbattery%E2%80%9D)
of accommodating the intermittency of wind and solar.)
 Similarly, the parallels that people inevitably draw between a
dentralised electricity system and the communication sector (i.e. where
fixed-line telephones were leap-frogged by cell phones) are misplaced.
Beyond [various other
differences](https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/why-the-phrase-energy-leapfrogging-is-misleading/),
cell phones networks are fundamentally centralised in nature: Cell phone
towers are the grid equivalent of the modern-day communications sector.

I should probably conclude by saying that I fully support
experimentation with decentralised systems. I just wouldn't want to put
my own money on it.
