## Motivation

This blog post pulls together various tips and suggestions that I've left
around the place. My main goal is to show you some simple workflows that I use 
for high-performance geospatial work in R, leaning on the **data.table**, **sf** 
and **geos** packages.

If you're the type of person who likes to load everything at once, here are the
R libraries and theme settings that I'll be using in this post. (Don't worry if
not: I'll be loading them again in the relevant sections below to underscore why
I'm calling a specific library.)

```{r libs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Data wrangling
library(dplyr)
library(data.table) ## NB: dev version! data.table::update.dev.pkg()

## Geospatial
library(sf)
library(geos)

## Plotting
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_minimal())

## Benchmarking
library(microbenchmark)
```

## data.table + sf workflow

Everyone who does spatial work in R is familiar with the wonderful **sf**
package. You know, this one:

```{r nc}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_minimal())

## Grab the North Carolina shapefile that comes bundled with sf
nc_shapefile = system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf")
nc = st_read(nc_shapefile)

## Quick plot
ggplot(nc) + geom_sf()
```

The revolutionary idea of **sf** was (is) that it allowed you to treat 
spatial objects as regular data frames, so you can do things like this:

```{r dplyr_union}
library(dplyr)

nc |>
  group_by(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low')) |>
  summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry)) |>
  ggplot(aes(fill=region)) + 
  geom_sf()
```

In the above code chunk, I'm using **dplyr** to do a 
grouped aggregation on our North Carolina data object. The aggregation itself is
pretty silly---i.e. divide the state into two hemispheres---but the same idea
extends to virtually all of **dplyr's** capabilities. It makes for a very 
potent and flexible combination that has driven an awful lot of R-based spatial
work in recent years.

At the same time, there's another powerful data wrangling library in R: 
**data.table**. This post is not going to rehash the (mostly pointless) debates 
about which of **dplyr** or **data.table** is better.[^1]
But I think it's fair to say that the latter offers incredible 
performance that makes it a must-use library for a lot of people, including
myself. Yet it seems to me that many **data.table** users aren't aware that 
you can use it for spatial operations in exactly the same way.

If you're following along on your own computer, make sure to grab the 
development version (v1.14.3) before continuing:

```{r updateDT, eval=FALSE}
## Assuming you have data.table on your system already
data.table::update.dev.pkg()

## Use the below instead if you don't have data.table installed already
# remotes::install_github("Rdatatable/data.table")
```

Okay, let's create a "data.table" version of our `nc` object and take a 
quick look at the first few rows and some columns.

```{r}
library(data.table)

nc_dt = as.data.table(nc)
nc_dt[1:3, c('NAME', 'CNTY_ID', 'geometry')]
```

At this point, I have to briefly back up to say that the reason I wanted you to
grab the development version of **data.table** is that it "pretty prints" the
columns by default. This not only includes the columns types and keys (if you've
set any), but also the special `sfc_MULTIPLOYGON` list columns which is where
the **sf** magic is hiding. It's a small cosmetic change that nonetheless
underscores the integration between these two packages.[^2]

Just like we did with **dplyr** earlier, we can now do grouped spatial 
operations on this object using **data.table**'s concise syntax:

```{r dt_union}
nc_dt[, 
      .(geometry = st_union(geometry)), 
      by = .(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low'))] |> 
  ggplot(aes(geometry=geometry, fill=region)) + 
  geom_sf() +
  labs(caption = "Now brought to you by data.table")
```

Now, I'll admit that there are a few tiny tweaks we need to make to the plot
call. Unlike with the non-**data.table** workflow, this time we have to specify
the geometry aesthetic with `aes(geometry=geometry, ...)`. Otherwise,
**ggplot2** won't know what do with this object. The other difference is that it
doesn't automatically recognise the CRS (i.e. "NAD27"), so the projection is a
little off. Again, however, that information is contained with the `geometry`
column of our `nc_dt` object. It just requires that we provide the CRS
to our plot call explicitly.

```{r dt_union_crs}
## Grab CRS from the geometry column
crs = st_crs(nc_dt$geometry)

## Update our previous plot
last_plot() + 
  coord_sf(crs=crs) +
  labs(caption = "Now with the right projection too")
```

Plotting tweaks aside, I don't want to lose sight of the main point of this
post, namely: **sf** and **data.table** play perfectly well together. You
can do (grouped) spatial operations and aggregations inside the latter, exactly
how you would any other data wrangling task. So if you love **data.table's**
performance and syntax, then by all means continue using it for your spatial
work too. Speaking of performance...

## Speeding things up with geos

_**Update (2022-02-16):** The benchmarks in this section are a bit unfair, since 
**geos** assumes planar ("flat") geometries, whereas **sf**  assumes spherical 
("curved") geometries by default. See the
[postscript](#postscript-planar-vs-spherical) at the bottom of this post, which 
corrects for this discrepancy._

As great as **sf** is, even its most ardent proponents will admit that it can
drag a bit when it comes to big geospatial tasks. I don't want to imply that
that it's "slow". But I've found that it does lag behind **geopandas**, for 
example, when I'm doing heavy geospatial computation or working with really 
large spatial files. Luckily, there's a new package in town that offers major 
performance gains and plays very well with the workflow I demonstrated above.

Dewey Dunnington and Edzer Pebesma's
[**geos**](https://paleolimbot.github.io/geos/index.html) package covers all of
the same basic geospatial 
[operations](https://paleolimbot.github.io/geos/reference/index.html) as **sf**. 
But it does so by directly wrapping the underlying `GEOS` API, which is written 
in C and is thus extremely performant. Here's a simple example, where we
calculate the centroid of each North Carolina county.

```{r centroid_bm}
library(geos)           ## For geos operations  
library(microbenchmark) ## For benchmarking

## Create a geos geometry object
nc_geos = nc |> as_geos_geometry()

## Benchmark
microbenchmark(
  sf = nc$geometry |> st_centroid(),
  geos = nc_geos |> geos_centroid(), 
  times = 5
  )
```

A couple of things worth noting. First, the **geos** centroid calculation
completes orders of magnitude faster than the **sf** equivalent. Second, the
executing functions are very similar (`st_centroid()` vs `geos_centroid()`).
Third, we have to do an explicit `as_geos_geometry()` coercion before we can
perform any **geos** operations on the resulting object.

That last point seems the most mundane. (_Why aren't you talking more about how
crazy fast **geos** is?!_) But it's important since it underscores a key 
difference between the two packages and why the developers view them as 
complements. Unlike **sf**, which treats spatial objects as data frames, 
**geos** only preserves the geometry attributes. Take a look:

```{r nc_geos_head}
head(nc_geos)
```

Gone are all those extra columns containing information about county names,
FIPS codes, population numbers, etc. etc. We're just left with the necessary 
information to do high-performance spatial operations.

### Quick aside on plotting geos objects

Because we've dropped all of the **sf** / data frame attributes, we can't use 
**ggplot2** to plot anymore. But we can use the base R plotting method:

```{r nc_geos_baseplot}
plot(nc_geos, col = "gray90")
plot(geos_centroid(nc_geos), pch = 21, col = 'red', bg = 'red', add = TRUE)
```

Actually, that's not quite true, since an alternative is to convert it back into an
**sf** object with `st_as_sf()` and then call **ggplot2**. This is particularly
useful because you can hand off some heavy calculation to **geos** before
bringing it back to **sf** for any additional functionality. Again, the 
developers of these packages designed them to act as complements.

```{r nc_geos_ggplot}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nc) +
  geom_sf(data = nc_geos |> geos_centroid() |> st_as_sf(), 
          col = "red")
```

Okay, back to the main post...

### data.table + geos workflow

Finally, we get to the _pièce de résistance_ of today's post. The fact that 
`as_geos_geometry()` creates a GEOS geometry object---rather than
preserving all of the data frame attributes---is a good thing for our
**data.table** workflow. Why? Well, because we can just include this
geometry object as a list column inside our data.table.[^3] 
In turn, this means you can treat spatial operations as you would any other 
operation inside a data.table. You can aggregate by group, merge, compare, 
and generally **combine the power of data.table and geos** as you see fit.

(The same is true for regular data frames and tibbles, but we'll get to that.)

Let's prove that this idea works by creating a GEOS column in our data.table. 
I'll creatively call this column `geo`, but really you could call it anything
you want (including overwriting the existing `geometry` column).

```{r nc_geos_dt}
nc_dt[, geo := as_geos_geometry(geometry)]
nc_dt[1:3, c('NAME', 'CNTY_ID', 'geo')] ## Print a few rows/columns
```

GEOS column in hand, we can manipulate or plot it directly from within the 
data.table. For example, we can recreate our previous centroid plot.

```{r dt_geos_centroid}
plot(nc_dt[, geo], col = "gray90")
plot(nc_dt[, geos_centroid(geo)], pch = 21, col = 'red', bg = 'red', add = TRUE)
```

And here's how we could replicate our earlier "hemisphere" plot:

```{r geos_union}
nc_dt[,
      .(geo = geo |> geos_make_collection() |> geos_unary_union()),
      by = .(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low'))
      ][, geo] |>
  plot()
```

This time around the translation from the equivalent **sf** code isn't as 
direct. We have one step (`st_union()`) vs. two 
(`geos_make_collection() |> geos_unary_union()`). The second `geo_unary_union()`
step is clear enough. But it's the first `geos_make_collection()`step that's
key for our aggregating task. We have to tell **geos** to treat everything
within the same group (i.e. whatever is in `by = ...`) as a collective. This 
extra step becomes very natural after you've done it a few times and is a small
price to pay for the resulting performance boost.

Speaking of which, it's nearly time for some final benchmarks. The only extra
thing I want to do first is, as promised, include a **tibble**/**dplyr**
equivalent. The exact same concepts and benefits carry over here, for those of
you that prefer the tidyverse syntax and 
workflow.[^4]

```{r nc_tibble}
nc_tibble = tibble::as_tibble(nc) |> 
  mutate(geo = as_geos_geometry(geometry))
```

### Benchmarks

For this final set of benchmarks, I'm going to horserace the same grouped
aggregation that we've been using throughout.

```{r agg_bm}
microbenchmark(
  
  sf_tidy = nc |>
    group_by(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low')) |>
    summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry)),
  
  sf_dt = nc_dt[, 
                .(geometry = st_union(geometry)), 
                by = .(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low'))],
  
  geos_tidy = nc_tibble |>  
    group_by(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low')) |>
    summarise(geo = geos_unary_union(geos_make_collection(geo))),
  
  geos_dt = nc_dt[,
                  .(geo = geos_unary_union(geos_make_collection(geo))),
                  by = .(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low'))],
  
  times = 5
)
```

**Result:** A 10x speed-up. Nice! While the toy dataset that we're using here is 
too small to make a meaningful difference in practice, those same 
performance benefits will carry over to big geospatial tasks too. Being able to 
reduce your computation time by a factor of 10 really makes a difference once 
you're talking minutes or hours.

## Conclusion

My takeaways:

1. It's fine to treat **sf** objects as **data.tables** (or vice versa) if 
that's your preferred workflow. Just remember to specify the geometry column.

2. For large (or small!) geospatial tasks, give the **geos** package a go. 
It integrates very well with both **data.table** and the **tidyverse**, and the 
high-performance benefits carry over to both ecosystems.

By the way, there are more exciting high-performance geospatial developments on 
the way in R (as well as other languages) like
[**geoarrow**](https://github.com/paleolimbot/geoarrow). We're lucky to have 
these tools at our disposal.

### Postscript: planar vs spherical 

_Note: This section was added on 2021-01-16._

As Roger Bivand 
[points out](https://twitter.com/RogerBivand/status/1482691924561698817) on 
Twitter, I'm not truly comparing apples with apples in the above benchmarks. 
**geos** assumes planar ("flat") geometries, whereas **sf** does the more 
complicated task of calculating spherical ("curved") geometries. More on that
[here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf7.html) if you are interested.
Below I repeat these same benchmarks, but with **sf** switched to the same
planar backend. The upshot is that **geos** is still faster, but the gap narrows
considerably. A reminder that we're also dealing with a very small dataset, so I
recommend benchmarking on your own datasets to avoid the influence of misleading
overhead. But I stand by my comment that these differences persist at scale, 
based on my own experiences and testing.

```{r s2_false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Turn off sf's spherical ("S2") backend
sf_use_s2(FALSE)

## Now redo our earlier benchmarks...

## Centroid
microbenchmark(
  sf = nc$geometry |> st_centroid(),
  geos = nc_geos |> geos_centroid(), 
  times = 5
  )

## Hemisphere aggregation
microbenchmark(
  sf_tidy = nc |>
    group_by(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low')) |>
    summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry)),
  sf_dt = nc_dt[, 
                .(geometry = st_union(geometry)), 
                by = .(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low'))],
  geos_tidy = nc_tibble |>  
    group_by(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low')) |>
    summarise(geo = geos_unary_union(geos_make_collection(geo))),
  geos_dt = nc_dt[,
                  .(geo = geos_unary_union(geos_make_collection(geo))),
                  by = .(region = ifelse(CNTY_ID<=1980, 'high', 'low'))],
  times = 5
  )
```

[^1]: Use what you want, people.

[^2]: None of the actual _functionality_ that I show here requires the dev version of **data.table**. But I recommend downloading it regardless, since v1.14.3 is set to introduce a bunch of other [killer features](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/news/index.html#unreleased-data-table-v1-14-3-in-development-). I might write up a list of my favourites once the new version hits CRAN. In the meantime, if any DT devs are reading this, _please pretty please_ can we include these two PRs ([1](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4163), [2](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4883)) into the next release too.

[^3]: Yes, yes. I know you can include a (list) column of data frames within a data.table. But just bear with me for the moment.

[^4]: The important thing is that you _explicitly_ convert it to a tibble. Leaving it as an **sf** object won't yield the same speed benefits.
