Below is a video of the late climate scientist, <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Schneider" target="_blank">Stephen Schneider</u></a>. Please watch it and tell me that scientists are the ones trying to polarize this debate and&nbsp;selectively&nbsp;feed us alarmist harbingers of doom. Specifically note Schneider's comment at the 3:35 mark on the false dichotomies, "end of the world" and "good for you".<br /><br />I see (environmental) economists as making meaningful contributions to this project as well. Cutting through the&nbsp;extreme and distortionist views, so that we can finally settle on some sensible solutions. At times that seems too much to hope for, but every&nbsp;skeptic&nbsp;could do with an optimistic streak...<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gDM3T0-o3r0" width="560"></iframe><br /><br /><b>UPDATE:</b> From 6:04, Schneider provides a great summary of the role that risk management plays in this whole climate debate. I'd refer readers to <u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-06-09-climate-change-and-balance-of %}" target="_blank">this post</u></a>, where I make very similar observations on risk probabilities and insurance decisions.
