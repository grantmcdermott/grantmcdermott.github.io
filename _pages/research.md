## Working papers

"Labor reallocation and remote work during COVID-19: Real-time evidence from GitHub." With B. Hansen. NBER Working Paper no. [w29598](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29598){:target="_blank"}.

"Hydro power. Market might." [Paper]({{ site.url }}/papers/hydro.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

<!--
*A central tenet of economic theory is that market power induces deadweight loss. This claim rests on an assumption that is difficult to verify empirically. Namely, that dominant firms produce less than the social optimum. I provide evidence of such restrictive behaviour using a rich dataset of Norwegian hydropower firms. The research design exploits exogenous variation in market power, arising from transmission bottlenecks and the formation of localized electricity markets. The unique production traits of hydropower production further helps to avoid empirical complications associated with marginal cost estimation and endogenous variation in the supply mix. This allows me to identify the causal impact of market power on firm behaviour in a reduced-form setting that requires minimal assumptions. I show that gaining pivotal status can cause firms to withhold production by as much as a two to five percent. My results suggest that even nominally competitive markets are susceptible to strategic manipulation and welfare losses.* ([Paper]({{ site.url }}/papers/hydro.pdf){:target="_blank"}.)

## Selected works in progress

"The value of mass information: Search in the Google era." With Christopher J. Costello and Michael B. Ward.

<!--
*A broad class of economic decision problems involves searching over a collection of uncertain research leads. Existing search theory informs the efficient search over this pool using available information. But in many cases, the researcher has the opportunity to collect new information en masse, e.g. with a search engine or scientific framework, that will benefit the search. We derive the value of this type of bulk information, determine the general properties that render it large or small, and calculate its implications for economic innovation. We show that changes to the underlying characteristics of different search problems can yield surprising results. For example, more lucrative end-prizes can actually reduce the value of information, while the possibility of better information often suppresses innovation.*
