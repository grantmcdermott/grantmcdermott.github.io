I am an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oregon. My research fields are environmental and resource economics, which means that I study the interactions between human and natural systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in questions like: 

- How do changes in environmental conditions affect the economy, and vice versa? 
- How should societies manage their natural resources when they are faced with uncertainty? 
- Do environmental policies function as intended, or are there unexpected consequences?

While there are important theoretical components to these questions, my work is mostly empirical. I rely on a mix of tools that includes classical econometrics, Bayesian methods, geospatial computation, and newer data science tools like machine learning. 

Alongside my regular research, I spend quite a lot time thinking about how to promote better coding practices among social scientists (including, most of all, myself). I am an advocate for open and reproducible science, as well as open-source software. You can find various materials along these lines on my website.
